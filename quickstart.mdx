## Setup Your Environment

Before you begin, make sure you have:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="wallet" title="Wallet with ETH">
    You'll need a wallet with testnet ETH on both chains for gas fees
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="coins" title="Testnet USDT">
    Use our faucet endpoint to get testnet USDT for testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Quick Start

<Steps>
  <Step title="Get Testnet USDT">
    First, request some testnet USDT from our faucet:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-api.com/faucet/usdt \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "address": "0xYourAddress",
        "chain": "base-sepolia",
        "amount": "10"
      }'
    ```

    <Tip>The faucet will send 10 USDT by default if amount is not specified</Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Bridge Request">
    Create a bridge request to get your deposit address:

    ```bash
    curl -X POST https://your-api.com/bridge/create \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{
        "sourceChain": "base-sepolia",
        "destinationChain": "sepolia",
        "amountUSDT": "10",
        "destinationWallet": "0xYourDestinationAddress"
      }'
    ```

    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "success": true,
      "sessionId": "bridge_1234567890_abc123",
      "depositAddress": "0x...",
      "message": "Send 10 USDT to 0x... on base-sepolia"
    }
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Send USDT to Deposit Address">
    Transfer USDT to the deposit address you received. The bridge will detect your deposit automatically.

    <Warning>Make sure to send the exact amount specified in your bridge request</Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Monitor Status">
    Check your bridge status:

    ```bash
    curl https://your-api.com/bridge/status/bridge_1234567890_abc123
    ```

    Response:
    ```json
    {
      "sessionId": "bridge_1234567890_abc123",
      "status": "completed",
      "txHash": "0x...",
      "explorerUrl": "https://sepolia.basescan.org/tx/0x...",
      "layerZeroUrl": "https://testnet.layerzeroscan.com/tx/0x..."
    }
    ```
  </Step>
